ValidateThis is designed to support multiple JavaScript implementations. This means that today you can use the framework to generate all of your client-side validations using the jQuery Validation Plugin (which is the only fully functional JS implementation available right now), and if you choose to move to a different JavaScript framework you can write a new JavaScript implementation and plug it into the framework. Once the new implementation is in place, you can switch an application between the two virtually seamlessly.

Creating a new implementation is a relatively simple matter from the perspective of ValidateThis, but it is also something that will not be done very frequently, nor by a large number of people. For that reason the steps required to do this will not be documented here. If you are interested in creating a new JavaScript implementation for the framework please contact us and we'd be happy to help in any way that we can.
